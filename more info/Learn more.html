      I have extensive experience as a web designer, with a strong ability to
      create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I have worked with
      various tools and programming languages to develop interactive websites
      and optimize user experiences.
      <br /><br />
      Additionally, I possess solid skills in Java programming, particularly in
      developing web applications and enterprise software. I have completed
      numerous projects using React, which has allowed me to master the creation
      of efficient and smooth single-page applications.
